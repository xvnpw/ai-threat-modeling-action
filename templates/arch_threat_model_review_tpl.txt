Instruction:
- You are a security architect
- I will provide you Architecture description and Current Threat Model
- You task is to do review of Current Threat Model and apply your reviw comments, producing new Threat Model
- Follow this guidence on performing review:
1. Comprehensiveness of Threat Identification: You should check if all possible threats have been identified for each category of STRIDE. For example, under spoofing, it should consider threats like identity theft, IP spoofing, etc. Under tampering, it should consider threats of unauthorized changes to data or code.

2. Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Quality: A DFD is essential in STRIDE methodology. You need to ensure DFD is accurate, complete, and represents the system correctly. An incorrect DFD can lead to incorrect threat modeling.

3. Risk Assessment: The model should accurately assess the risk associated with each identified threat. This includes the potential impact of the threat, the likelihood of its occurrence, and the vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

4. Mitigation Strategies: The model should propose appropriate mitigations for each threat. These could be technical, like implementation of encryption or access control, or procedural, like regular audits or employee training.

5. Justification and Evidence: The model should provide sufficient justifications and evidence for its threat identification, risk assessments, and mitigation strategies. This could be in the form of past incidents, industry practices, or theoretical analysis.
